					<h2>Toy Story</h2>
					<p>With Chigrighata Kids</p>

						We collected toys from people in our college for over two weeks and then gifted them to these kids at Tapuriyaghata Nari Unnayan Kendra in Chingrighata.
We played passing the parcel. The kid who ended up with the parcel at the end of each round was asked to either recite or sing or dance. After that they were given the toys as prizes for their performances! The pictures surely tell us the lovely time that the kids had with the RC-HITK members.

					<h2>Sunderbans Pilot Project</h2>
					<p>How it all started</p>
				</div> <!-- .cd-title -->

				<div class="cd-project-info">
					<p>
						A haze rested on the muddy shores that ran out to sea in their vanishing flatness. The crimson flush of the sunset splashing over the waves quickly sank into the lilac twilight, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a river leading to the uttermost ends of the earth. Of all things that are etched in our memories from Sunderbans, itâ€™s the surreal beauty of the river and the sea that will drive you wild. The humble abode of the villagers, their simple ways of living, the fresh aroma from the steaming daal and rice will take you far from the glitz of the city aswarm with activity, into a heaven of serene happiness.
So this was an Environment project that we were a part of. This little hamlet, Kumirmadi, lies far from the mainland and has been one of the worst affected areas of the cyclone Aila. Due to deforestation, the Mangrove population has significantly gone down, thus exposing the soil to the whims of the tempestuous sea. The situation is so precarious that immediate plantation drives are extremely necessary. The muddy boundary wall that separates the waves from the houses, has crumbled once- and if this happens again, the villagers have little hope.
Devarchan and Pronobesh da, both Changelooms Fellows, work in this area. With them we assembled the kids in the school, had a drawing competition, and role playing with the kids. It was this drama and role playing that excited the kids the most. I bet I have never enjoyed EVS this much in my life!
This was followed by a march round the island, with posters and emphatic slogans from the kids. And at last we had a plantation drive, where the kids actually planted Sundari trees on the banks of the river. May the trees grow strong with their rising tide of hopes!
All in all, this was the best and most successful environment project we ever attended.
We shall be going there again soon. Very soon.
And we look forward to your active participation.

						The importance of waste management might be tough for elders to understand but for children its as simple as it gets .
RC HITK along with Garbage Free India took this initiative to spread awareness about waste management. The members of our club went to a School in a place named Kulti where the importance of disposing wastes was brought into light through charts, skits, group activities, presentations and a movie screening. The day ended by distributing small gifts and a clean up drive in and around the School.

					<h2>Thakurpukur Cancer Hospital</h2>
					<p></p>
				</div> <!-- .cd-title -->

				<div class="cd-project-info">
					<p>
						On the 31st of March, the patients at the Thakurpukur Cancer Hospital were greeted with a pleasant surprise. The Fingers Singing Group which happens to be a record holder in the Limca Book of Records, performed for them. 
The programme began with Nibedita Kundu's speech on the project about the red light area in Kalighat undertaken by the Central Government .This was followed by ballet painting by the Fingers Singing Group. As they danced to the tunes of popular Rabindrasangeet songs, their expert hands painted a portrait of Kabi Guru, Rabindranath. The audience was amazed. Not one stroke, not one expression of the painters cum dancers went wrong. Perfection was at its peak. Glitter painting followed. A group of younger dancers, danced to contemporary Hindi and Bengali songs while their group members painted with glue on a black chart paper. The audience was unable to comprehend what was being done. As the performance came to an end, the black chart paper was sprayed with silver glitter and the audience was presented with a mesmerising portrait of Radha-Krishna. 
The programme ended with the felicitation of the performers and handing over of Rs.5000 to Rekha Mashi, from the Kalighat red light area. The amount was received by selling the paintings made by the kids of the same area. It was in the end, a day filled with joy for the patients at the hospital.
